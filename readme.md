All data necessary for the project is included in the repo.  All code is written in Python3 and required modules can be downloaded with pip.  Note that the sentence bert models take several hours to download.  To see the model in action run testModel.py.

For full recreation of data preprocessing and model training run scripts in the following order:

genLabelMaps.py
preprocess.py
trainModel.py
testModel.py

All file paths are relative and so shouldn't need to be changed for the code to run properly.
